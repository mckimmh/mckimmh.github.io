I'm a Research Associate in Statistics at Imperial College London, working in the field of Astrostatistics. I am collaborating with [David van Dyk](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.van-dyk) at Imperial, as well as [Vinay Kashyap](http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~kashyap/) and [Aneta Siemiginowska](https://hea-www.harvard.edu/~aneta/HomePage.html) at the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/). We are developing a Bayesian spectral model that accounts for a phenomenon called photon pile-up.

I did my PhD on Monte Carlo methods at the University of Warwick, where I was supervised by [Gareth Roberts](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/roberts/) and [Murray Pollock](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths-physics/people/profile/murraypollock.html). In addition to my supervisors, I worked closely with [Andi Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/andiqwang/home) and [Christian Robert](https://xianblog.wordpress.com/). I was enrolled on the [Oxford-Warwick Statistics Programme](http://www.oxwasp-cdt.ac.uk/), a joint Centre for Doctoral Training between the Universities of Oxford and Warwick. Before starting my PhD, I studied Mathematics at Durham University.
