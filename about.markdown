I'm a Research Assistant in Statistics at Imperial College London, working in the field of Astrostatistics. I am collaborating with David van Dyk at Imperial, as well as Vinay Kashyap and Aneta Siemiginowska at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. We are developing a Bayesian spectral model that accounts for a phenomenon called photon pile-up.

I did my PhD on Monte Carlo methods at the University of Warwick, where I was supervised by Gareth Roberts and Murray Pollock. In addition to my supervisors, I worked closely with Andi Wang and Christian Robert. I was enrolled on the Oxford-Warwick Statistics Programme, a joint Centre for Doctoral Training between the Universities of Oxford and Warwick. Before starting my PhD, I studied Mathematics at Durham University.
