Linux is a family is an open-source operating system. The Linux kernel controls all the hardware and software on the computer. Utilities perform standard functions such as controlling files and programs. The shell is a special interactive utility, which allows users to start programs, manage files and manage processes running on the system. Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a popular shell.

There are many tutorials on Bash commands, but none are themed around song "Do-Re-Mi" from "The Sound of Music". This blog post remedies that absence.

*Do* is for the `do` in `for` loops. The basic structure of a `for` loop is:
    for variable in list_of_items
    do
        command1 $variable
    done

Re - grep

Mi - mkdir

Fa - functions

So - source

La - ls

Ti - time
