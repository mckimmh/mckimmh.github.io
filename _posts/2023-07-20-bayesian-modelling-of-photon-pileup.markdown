I recently presented a poster on ongoing work on Bayesian modelling of photon pile-up at Statistical Challenges in Modern Astronomy VIII at Penn State University in the USA.

The aim of the project is to design a Bayesian spectral model that takes into account a phenomenon called pile-up. That is, we aim to infer the parameters of the spectrum of an astronomical source, whilst allowing for the fact that pile-up may have affected the data. A detector onboard a telescope records the energy of photons arriving at the detector's surface during short time-intervals, usually of a few seconds in duration. Pile-up occurs when two or more photons arrive during the same time-interval, in which case the sum of their energies will be recorded as the energy of a single photon.

For example in the figure below ...
