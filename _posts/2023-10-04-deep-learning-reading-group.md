This page displays information about the Deep Learning Reading Group at the Mathematics Department at Imperial College London in 2023. The group will aim to learn the fundamentals of the topic (as opposed to recent advances). The main focus is the textbook ''Deep Learning'' by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville (2016), but we also read some papers. Meetings are irregularly spaced, but occur on Tuesdays at 4pm in SHER-04-402. If you are an Imperial College London student or staff member and would like to attend, please feel free!
